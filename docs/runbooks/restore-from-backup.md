# Platform Restore — from a backup set

**Who this is for:** anyone with (1) access to this repo, (2) access to the Supabase
project, and (3) access to the offsite backup location. It deliberately assumes
**nothing about the machine you are on** — not Windows, not `C:/Projects`, not any
prior DeepBench setup. If you are John on John's machine, everything here still works;
the machine-specific paths appear only as the *legacy defaults*.

**Why it exists:** the Supabase project (`rallojeqnkgtxgsdsnqm`, org `roadmapventure`)
is on the **free** plan — no automated backups, no PITR, no restore button. The backup
sets this runbook restores from are the only recovery net. Charter context:
`docs/SELFBUILD-CHARTER.md` §Rollback plan; provenance: `SES-169` (M0 snapshot),
gate-review card `a458c50a` (found the whole restore path was one machine deep),
`SES-193` (this runbook), `SES-192` (the offsite copy).

---

## 1. What a backup set is

One directory per snapshot, named `<label>-<YYYY-MM-DD>` (e.g.
`selfbuild-step0-2026-08-23`), containing:

| Path | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `data/<table>.ndjson` | Every base table, one JSON object per line (52 tables as of 2026-08-23; the list is **dynamic** — read from `public._backup_inventory` at dump time, so new tables are never silently skipped — `SES-81`) |
| `schema.sql` | Full schema (tables, constraints, indexes, views, functions, triggers, policies, ACLs) generated from `pg_catalog` |
| `migrations.sql` | The complete migration history — these exist **only in the database**; the repo has no `.sql` files |
| `manifest.json` | Per-table row counts, byte sizes, sha256 checksums, and dump-time PK-set verification results |
| `machine-local/` | The 7 governance hook scripts + `settings.json` + `settings.local.json` from the session machine's `.claude/` directory — **not git-tracked anywhere** |
| `RESTORE-PROCEDURE.md` | That snapshot's own restore notes (snapshot-specific; this runbook is the canonical procedure) |

The tooling (`dump-supabase.mjs`, `restore-supabase.mjs`, `verify-backup.mjs`,
`README.md`) lives in the backup location root, alongside the set directories, and is
included in the offsite copy — you do not need any of it pre-installed.

## 2. Where backup sets live

- **Primary (where dumps are taken):** `C:/Projects/deepbench-backups` on John's
  machine.
- **Offsite:** see §7 — location, contents, and refresh cadence are recorded there.
  If John's machine is gone, start from the offsite copy.

## 3. Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (the scripts use global `fetch`; no Docker, no `psql`, no DB
  password).
- **Repo access:** `github.com/roadmapventure/deepbench-frontend`.
- **Supabase credentials:** the project URL and the `service_role` key, from the
  Supabase dashboard → project `rallojeqnkgtxgsdsnqm` → Settings → API. (If the
  dashboard itself is unreachable, these are exactly the credentials that cannot be
  recovered from a backup — see §6.)
- **The backup set** — copied local from the offsite location (or already on disk).

**Handing the scripts your credentials** — three ways, first match wins:

```bash
# 1. Environment variables (works anywhere)
export SUPABASE_URL="https://<project>.supabase.co"
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="<service_role key>"

# 2. Any env file, pointed at explicitly
export DEEPBENCH_ENV_FILE="/path/to/some.env"   # file with the two lines above

# 3. Legacy default (John's machine only): C:/Projects/deepbench-frontend/.env.local
```

Never commit these values anywhere, and never paste them into chat, docs, or tickets.

## 4. Always first: verify integrity (read-only)

```bash
node restore-supabase.mjs <backup-set-dir> --verify-only
```

Every file is re-hashed against `manifest.json`. Anything altered or missing is named
and the script exits non-zero. The restore path **refuses to run** from an altered set.

## 5. The restore, by layer

Restore only the layers you actually lost. The common case is **one table back the way
it was**, not "everything burned down."

### 5a. One table (or one row) — the common case

```bash
# Dry run (default — nothing is written):
node restore-supabase.mjs <backup-set-dir> --tables=agents

# Apply:
node restore-supabase.mjs <backup-set-dir> --tables=agents --confirm
```

Writes are **upserts on the primary key**: idempotent, re-runnable, and rows added
since the backup are left alone — this restores, it does not delete. For a single row
or just reading old values, the `.ndjson` files are plain text — grep them.

### 5b. Full data restore

```bash
node restore-supabase.mjs <backup-set-dir> --all --confirm
```

Foreign-key ordering is handled by multi-pass retry; a genuinely stuck table (parent
not in the restore set) is named at the end and exits non-zero.

### 5c. Schema — new/empty project only

Run `schema.sql` against the new project (Supabase dashboard SQL editor works; paste
in sections if it times out). Then compare against `migrations.sql` — schema.sql is
the *current* structure, migrations.sql is the *history with rationale*. Never run
`schema.sql` against a live populated project.

### 5d. Repo — the Selfbuild rollback point

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roadmapventure/deepbench-frontend
git checkout governance-pre-selfbuild-0823   # tag on origin, dev commit 47000427 —
                                             # the last commit before any Selfbuild change
```

For an ordinary (non-rollback) rebuild, current `dev` is the state to use. Pushing a
rollback to the shared `dev` branch follows branch discipline: John's sign-off,
`push origin HEAD:dev`.

### 5e. Machine-local governance hooks

On whatever machine will run Claude Code sessions, copy `machine-local/settings.json`
and `machine-local/hooks/*.js` into the `.claude/` directory of the **parent** of the
repo checkout (on John's machine that is `C:/Projects/.claude/`; on another machine,
whatever directory you clone under — the hooks guard the session, not the repo).
`settings.local.json` is permission-allowlist state; copy it too if rebuilding John's
own machine, skip it for a fresh contributor. The hooks are a **backstop, not the
source of truth** — the written rules in `CLAUDE.md` bind even where hooks are absent.

### 5f. Resume the platform

Scheduler back on via the briefing page §2b Automation panel; re-declare any drain
John wants (drains are John-declared rows in `runner_directives`, never
self-activated).

## 6. What is NOT in a backup set (know before you need it)

- **Secret values.** The offsite copy's `data/runner_secrets.ndjson` is **redacted**
  (names and notes kept, values nulled), and the Vercel bypass secret embedded in
  `machine-local/settings.local.json`'s permission entries is replaced with
  `<REDACTED-SES-192>`. After a restore, re-enter the five named secrets from their
  sources (Anthropic console, Supabase dashboard, Vercel dashboard). **Never run a
  restore of `runner_secrets` from the offsite copy** — the upsert would overwrite
  live values with nulls. On machine loss, rotating these keys is prudent anyway.
- **Storage object contents** — bucket metadata is dumped, file contents are not.
- **Custom role passwords** — not retrievable.
- **`.env.local`** — deliberately never in any backup set; rebuild it from the same
  dashboards as above.

## 7. Offsite copy — location, contents, cadence (SES-192)

- **Location:** private GitHub repo
  **`github.com/roadmapventure/deepbench-backups-offsite`** (first upload
  2026-08-24, commit `8d608a6` — John's call, switched from the Google Drive
  candidate because Drive had no automatable upload path from this tooling).
- **Contents:** one directory per backup set, **named with its snapshot date**
  (`selfbuild-step0-2026-08-23/`), holding `data/`, `schema.sql`, `migrations.sql`,
  `manifest.json`, `machine-local/`, and the set's `RESTORE-PROCEDURE.md` — **with
  secrets redacted as described in §6** (`runner_secrets` values nulled;
  the Vercel bypass secret in `machine-local/settings.local.json` replaced with
  `<REDACTED-SES-192>`; the set's `manifest.json` re-hashed for the redacted file so
  `--verify-only` passes as-is) — plus the tooling at the repo root
  (`dump-supabase.mjs`, `restore-supabase.mjs`, `verify-backup.mjs`,
  `TOOLING-README.md`). A `.gitattributes` (`* -text`) pins byte-for-byte fidelity
  so the manifest sha256s survive a clone on any OS.
- **Point-in-time copy.** Each set is a snapshot as of its named date — the current
  upload is the **2026-08-23 Step 0 set**. Anyone restoring from it must expect to
  lose everything written after that date unless a fresher set exists.
- **Refresh cadence:** after every new snapshot (a snapshot is taken **before any
  session that moves data around**), commit and push the new set the same day. Each
  refresh must re-run the redaction + leak scan before committing — never push a raw
  set. Watch the per-file size: GitHub hard-rejects files over 100 MB and
  `durable_hops.ndjson` is already 73 MB; if a table dump approaches the limit,
  split it or move it to LFS (raise at the M4 gate).
- **Automated refresh is deliberately NOT solved here** (John, 2026-08-24): a cloud
  cycle re-dumping to the offsite location on a schedule, versus Supabase paid PITR,
  is the M4 gate's design question per the charter's open budget item
  (`docs/SELFBUILD-CHARTER.md` §Open questions). Until that decision, the refresh in
  the bullet above is a manual step.

  the bullet above is a manual step.

## 8. Taking a new backup

```bash
node dump-supabase.mjs <backup-root>/<label>-<YYYY-MM-DD>
```

Same credential rules as §3. Keyset-paginated against a live database and PK-set
verified per table (`manifest.json` records `verified` / `missing_count` /
`extra_count`; `missing_count > 0` is the real failure and exits non-zero). Then
refresh the offsite copy per §7.

## 9. Known standing gaps

- The **full restore drill** (schema + data into a clean project, end to end) is
  `SES-191` — "the full restore drill" (Selfbuild M3); until it runs, the full-restore
  path in §5b/§5c is verified only in miniature (one-table live restore, dump-time
  PK verification, checksum integrity).
- View data can fail to dump (e.g. `ai_call_patterns`, server-side timeout) —
  harmless; views are derived and rebuild from `schema.sql`.
