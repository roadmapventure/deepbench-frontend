## PERSONNEL FILE — PE

| ID | Feature | Status | Session |
|----|---------|--------|---------|
| PE-01 | Profile tab | ✅ Done | DONE |
| PE-02 | Resume tab | ✅ Done | DONE |
| PE-03 | Training tab live wiring — load from Supabase, toggle, delete, NIGP card layout (date col + green node + right-side actions) | ✅ Done | S-MIGRATE-02 (02ff560) |
| PE-04 | Playbook tab live wiring (output_format CRUD + guardrails — ResumeTab pattern) | 🔶 Partial (static mock) | S-MIGRATE-05 |
| PE-13 | Personnel file polish — remove "The Bench" back button from header, add ACTIVE/TRAINEE chips to sidebar, fix T.paper token bug in guardrail textareas | ✅ Done | S-BENCH-UX-01 (812ed59) |
| PE-12 | Training tab — Test Agent console (inline sub-view: config selectors, scenario picker, live brief + RAG call, system prompt inspector, RAG chunks panel) | ❌ Missing | S-MIGRATE-06 |
| PE-05 | Workflow tab (stub) | ✅ Done | DONE |
| PE-06 | Projects tab — live wiring to `deliverables` table; shows agent's completed deliverables: count, type, task name, date; stub until DL-04 ships | 🔶 Partial (stub) | S-DELIVER-04 |
| PE-07 | Left-sidebar nav (OVERVIEW + CONFIGURE groups, no OPERATE); replaces horizontal tab bar | ✅ Done | S-MIGRATE-01b (8660e42) |
| PE-08 | Profile tab 2-col layout — ID Badge + Compensation left; Readiness + Intel Config + Quick Stats right | ✅ Done | S-MIGRATE-01b (8660e42) |
| PE-09 | Page header breadcrumb from NAV_GROUPS; subtitle uses -level agent (not -level analyst) | ✅ Done | S-MIGRATE-01b (8660e42) |
| PE-10 | Training tab — Add Courses inline sub-view (upload → extract → ingest pipeline, embedded in Training tab, no page navigation) | ✅ Done | S-MIGRATE-03 (299f1c0) + patch (686007e) |
| PE-11 | Training tab — Edit Course inline sub-view (edit title, category, jurisdiction, field notes, triggers, priority — no re-vectorization; EDIT+DELETE only for trainable+active entries) | ✅ Done | S-MIGRATE-04 (732bf3c) |
| PE-14 | Training tab — "What X Learned" panel UX fix: (1) move AiBadge outside the expandable so it is visible immediately before and after expansion; (2) replace clickable expansion trigger with inline "more..." text after "What X Learned" label | ❌ Missing | S-future |
| PE-15 | Training tab — Add Courses loading state: (1) spinner + status text during Exhibit B pre-fill lag so user knows system is working and cannot click "Teach X this document" yet; (2) AiBadge + AI pulse icon on Exhibit B section showing the pattern being used (KNOWLEDGE_TRAINING) | ❌ Missing | S-future |
| PE-16 | Playbook tab — guardrails section AI Pulse + hover label: add `<AIDiamond>` to the guardrails card header (always/never section) with a hover label identifying PAT-13 Guardrails / Output Filtering as the pattern these constraints feed into. AIDiamond should render in inactive/roadmap state (PAT-13 is `active: false` in PATTERN_CATALOG) — visually distinct from a live-pattern pulse. Exact inactive AIDiamond treatment must be specced in the AI-34/AI-31 design session before this can be coded. Depends on: PE-04 ✅ Done, AI-34 design (AIDiamond pattern label spec). File: PersonnelScreen.jsx (Playbook tab). | ❌ Missing | S-future (depends on AI-34 design session) |

**PE-04 spec locked 2026-06-09 (S-MIGRATE-05 design session):**
- Output formats: full CRUD via `/api/agent-configs?type=output_format` — identical to ResumeTab `role_prompt` pattern
- Guardrails: two separate records — `name: "always"` and `name: "never"`, both `type: "guardrail"` — autosaved on blur; no canEdit gate (any agent editable)
- Both sections loaded in single `Promise.all` on mount
- `ConfigCard` and `AddConfigForm` promoted to shared scope (named exports from ResumeTab or inlined above ProfileTab)
- `AddConfigForm` parameterized with `type` prop — not hardcoded `"role_prompt"`
- `canEdit = agent.trainable` gate: Add/Edit/Delete hidden for non-trainable agents; guardrail textarea read-only
- Guardrails corner ornament: `<Corners color={T.flag} />` (already in static mock — preserve)
- `handleSetDefault`: re-fetch full list after PATCH (not optimistic — server is source of truth)
- `handleFormatAdded`: if new config `is_default`, zero out existing defaults before prepending
- Kickoff doc: `docs/kickoffs/v5.1.26-PE-04-playbook-tab-crud.md`

**PE-12 spec (S-MIGRATE-06 — needs design session):**
- NIGP reference: `nigp-analyzer/src/PersonnelScreen.jsx` — TrainingTabWithSubViewSync, `subView === "test"` branch
- Entry point: "🐝 Test Agent" button in Training tab stats strip (alongside existing "+ Add Courses")
- Config selectors bar: Role Prompt dropdown + Output Format dropdown (loads from agent-configs on test mount)
- Scenario picker: 5 pre-built procurement scenarios (adapt from NIGP's BEE_SCENARIOS — DeepBench scenarios TBD in design session)
- Run Test: live `/api/brief` call with `role_prompt_id`, `output_format_id`, RAG context injected
- Results panel: agent response + debug strip (Role, Format, Layers assembled, RAG retrieved)
- System prompt inspector: expandable, color-coded by layer (L01 purple, L02 moss, L04 brass, L05 flag-red)
- RAG chunks panel: expandable, shows retrieved docs + similarity scores
- Design session required before coding — scenarios and UI layout need approval

**PE-11 spec locked 2026-06-09 (S-MIGRATE-04 design session):**
- Reuses AddCourseView with `existingEntry` prop — no separate EditCourseView component
- Edit opens inline in Personnel File window (left nav + page header remain visible) — NOT a new screen
- Exhibit A shows "Document on file" card — no file upload, no re-vectorization
- Save button label: "▸ Save Course Detail" (not "Teach X this document")
- EDIT + DELETE: only shown when `agent.trainable && entry.status === "active"` (NIGP parity)
- PATCH endpoint extended: `api/knowledge-entry.js` accepts title, category, jurisdiction, teaching_note, triggers, priority
- All form fields editable: title, category, jurisdiction, priority, triggers, teaching note (NIGP parity)
- Kickoff doc: `docs/kickoffs/v5.1.26-PE11-edit-course.md`

**PE design decisions locked 2026-06-08 (S-MIGRATE-UX):**
- Left nav replaces horizontal tab bar. Nav groups: OVERVIEW (Profile) + CONFIGURE (Resume, Training, Playbook). No OPERATE section.
- "Assignments" and "Completed Projects" removed as nav items → become sections on Profile tab (PE-08, PE-09).
- "← Team Builder" bottom-left button → removed.
- Top nav handled by DeepBench AppShell (Work + Bench) — no NIGP-specific buttons.
- Profile tab layout: NIGP 2-col (ID Badge + Compensation left; Readiness + Intel Config + Quick Stats right).
- Avatar on Profile tab: initial circle only (illustrated avatar is Roster-only).
- Future: Resume/Training/Playbook sub-page design pulled from NIGP in a dedicated design session.
- Future: Training inline Teach+Test sub-views (NIGP pattern) will deprecate TeachScreen.jsx + TestTeamScreen.jsx.
- Future: Assignments + Completed live wiring to tasks table (separate session).

## TEACH — TC

| ID | Feature | Status | Session |
|----|---------|--------|---------|
| TC-01 | Upload → extract → ingest → RAG | ✅ Done | DONE |
| TC-02 | Trainer Agent — dedicated agent role that trains/configures other agents; visible as participant in multi-agent workflows; shows who taught an agent in the personnel file training log | ❌ Missing | S-future |

**TC-02 Notes (added 2026-06-09):**
- Named agent: **Susan Smith (TR-08)** — Trainer Agent role
- Concept: Trainer is a named agent (not a user action) — another AI agent assigned to teach/configure peer agents
- Visible in Training tab: each entry shows which agent (or user) added it
- Multi-agent workflow: Trainer agent can be called into a task workflow to onboard or retrain a bench agent mid-project
- Design session required before implementation — full spec in S-BENCH-01b

| AI-19 | Latency capture for extraction + reinforcement call sites — wrap fetch() with Date.now() timing so avg latency shows in AI Audit (currently "—" for Susan + OpenAI rows) | ❌ Missing | S-future |
| AI-20 | AI Audit cost formatter — replace `<$0.01` floor with 4-decimal display so sub-penny costs show visible movement (e.g. `$0.0023`); one-liner change to `fmt$` in AIActivityPanel.jsx | ❌ Missing | S-future |
| AI-21 | AI Audit output token tracking — extend `logAICall()` to accept `outputTokens` param; include output cost in formula; write to existing `output_tokens` column in ai_activity_log; all `logAICall()` call sites updated | ❌ Missing | S-future |
| AI-22 | Full lineage columns on `ai_activity_log` — add `service_slug`, `service_version`, `deliverable_id`, `step_id`, `level` so every AI call is traceable from Task → Step → Agent → Service → Pattern → Deliverable → Cost. Also adds `success` boolean and `error_type` for Service Health (AI-27). Do alongside S-INFRA-01. All `logAICall()` call sites updated. | ❌ Missing | S-INFRA-01 |
| AI-23 | AI Audit rebuilt on AI Services model — five sections replace current "By Activity Type": (1) By Service — one row per AI/Mixed Service, columns: Service Name · Type · Calls · Est. Cost · Avg Latency; (2) By Pattern — one row per AI Pattern rolled up from Services declaring it; (3) Deterministic — execution count + latency for deterministic Services, no LLM cost; (4) By LLM — keep existing; (5) By Agent — keep existing. Existing ai_type strings remapped to service_slug values. Requires `ai_services` table (AI-25). Design session: S-AI-AUDIT-REDESIGN. | ✅ Done | S-AI-AUDIT-REDESIGN (da40458 + f0ecd09) |
| AI-24 | Routing feedback loop — deliverable approval and change-request rates produce a per-agent-capability preference score; routing uses Capability match + Level + approval history as a third factor after Seniority. Design session required before building. | ❌ Missing | S-future (after S-DELIVER-04) |
| AI-25 | `ai_services` table — Supabase catalog of all 14 named Services: slug, name, service_type (ai/deterministic/mixed), description, patterns jsonb (array of pattern slugs), properties jsonb (llm_provider, llm_model, token_budget, execution_mode, rag_match_count, byok_eligible), in_nigp, in_deepbench, current_route, target_route, version, created_at. Seed with all 14 services (SVC-01 through SVC-14) on creation. | ❌ Missing | S-INFRA-01 |
| AI-26 | `ai_patterns` table — Supabase catalog of 20 industry-standard AI Patterns: slug, name, description, in_deepbench boolean (true = active, false = roadmap).

| AI-30 | AI Audit By Pattern section: expand client-side pattern catalog from 10 to 20 entries (PAT-01–PAT-20); update Patterns Roadmap section (Now/Next/Later) with PAT-12 through PAT-20; update header stat to reflect new totals. HITL row (PAT-10) uses "Gates Triggered" + "Avg Response Time" columns instead of LLM Calls / Cost / Latency — source is task execution log not ai_activity_log; show as 🔶 Partial until TI-18 ships. PAT-14 Parallelization shows as 🔶 Partial (TT-01/02). One file: AIActivityPanel.jsx. | ✅ Done | S-AI-BADGE-04 (5c2b8d2) |
| AI-32 | By Pattern section — "Not yet active" collapse card: group all inactive patterns (those showing "Not yet active" chip) into a collapsed card identical to "Not yet called · N services" in By Service section. Collapsed by default. Click to expand and see all inactive pattern rows. HITL (hitlSpecial) and Parallelization (partial) stay as individual rows. File: AIActivityPanel.jsx. | ✅ Done | S-AI-AUDIT-UX-01 (c919af4) |
| AI-33 | Platform Roadmap redesign — replace current flat Services + AI Patterns lists with 2-section × 2-column layout: Next and Later only (no Now — all Now items already coded). Each section: AI Patterns (left) + DeepBench Services (right). Data driven from PATTERN_CATALOG and SERVICE_CATALOG roadmap fields. File: AIActivityPanel.jsx. | ✅ Done | S-AI-AUDIT-UX-01 (c919af4) |
| AI-27 | Service Health tracking — `success` boolean + `error_type` text column on `ai_activity_log`; enables per-Service failure rate, uptime, and p50/p95 latency in AI Audit. Part of AI-22 lineage work or separate extension. | ❌ Missing | S-INFRA-01 |
| AI-28 | AiBadge label sweep — update all 21 existing AiBadge tooltip labels app-wide to AI Pattern names (full pattern list per responsible service); remove FlagCard deterministic badge (SharedUI); add `built` prop to AiBadge for greyed/dashed visual when pattern not yet implemented. Constants centralized in `src/aiPatterns.js`. Three coding sessions: S-AI-BADGE-01/02/03. | ✅ Done | S-AI-BADGE-01 ✅ (a6d00c9) — S-AI-BADGE-02 ✅ (b03d04e) — S-AI-BADGE-03 ✅ (8d63915) |
| AI-29 | Step card conditional pattern badge — derive execution patterns from assigned agent code (Approach A: agent→AGENT_PATTERNS map) with step-name keyword fallback (Approach B); HITL steps = no badge; greyed dashed badge for unbuilt patterns (Pat IR-07, Susan TR-08, multi-agent PAT-11); no badge on deterministic steps. | ✅ Done | S-AI-BADGE-02 (b03d04e) |
| AI-31 | Task Instructions AI pulse buttons — "Re-run All" and "Update Steps →" buttons each get AI activity signal + pattern label. Byline badge fix in AssignWorkScreen also shipped. Functionally complete (195aeda + 8bd3f23) but VISUAL TREATMENT WRONG: currently uses raw `<span>` dot + AiBadge chip, which is not in the style guide. Must be replaced with `<AIDiamond>` + pattern tooltip pattern (spec TBD in S-AI-AUDIT-UX-01). Files: TaskInstructionsScreen.jsx, StepList.jsx, AssignWorkScreen.jsx. | 🔶 Partial (visual redesign needed — see AI-31 notes) | S-AI-BADGE-05/05p ✅ functional · S-AI-AUDIT-UX-01 visual redesign |
| AI-34 | Step card AI pattern display — each step card in Task Instructions and Assign Work shows which AI patterns are used for that step, plus an `<AIDiamond>` AI pulse icon. Source: AGENT_PATTERNS map (same as AI-29). Visual treatment: AIDiamond + pattern label, exact placement TBD in design session. Do not use AiBadge chip for this. File: StepList.jsx. | ❌ Missing | S-AI-AUDIT-UX-01 (design session required) |
| AI-35 | Unified AI Pattern Registry — single source of truth for all pattern tracking across the platform. Replaces the current split between `PATTERN_CATALOG` (useAIActivity.js), `AI_PAT` constants + `AGENT_PATTERNS` map (aiPatterns.js), and scattered AiBadge label strings. The registry owns: (1) **Active status** — which patterns are actually firing in DeepBench code today vs roadmap-only, so AiBadge labels and the Platform Roadmap never contradict each other; (2) **Label/feature associations** — which UI elements (buttons, cards, step types) declare each pattern, so AiBadge labels derive from the registry instead of being hardcoded per component; (3) **AI Audit display** — By Pattern row status (active/partial/roadmap) and roadmap tier driven from one source; (4) **Metric logging** — pattern-level calls, cost, and latency logged directly to `ai_activity_log` via pattern slug, not only rolled up from service calls; (5) **Full graph** — each pattern knows which Services declare it, which Deliverables those Services produce, and which Capabilities invoke those Deliverables. Resolves the AI-28/PATTERN_CATALOG contradiction discovered 2026-06-15: AiBadge labels were set from SVC design intent (Reflection listed on Playbook badge) but PATTERN_CATALOG correctly marks Reflection inactive — a split source caused the inconsistency. Design session required before coding — needs: registry schema, migration path from aiPatterns.js + PATTERN_CATALOG, AiBadge label derivation mechanism, metric log schema. | ❌ Missing | S-PAT-REGISTRY-01 (design required) |
| AI-36 | Pattern type classification — every pattern in the registry carries a `patternType` field: `structural` (scaffolding around Claude — changes what Claude sees or when it is called, not how it reasons: RAG, Streaming, Structured Output, Embeddings, Browser Automation) or `reasoning` (changes how Claude thinks — same prompt produces meaningfully different output: ReAct, Tool Use, Prompt Chaining, Reflection, Multi-Agent Debate, Chain-of-Verification). Design requirement: (1) AI Audit By Pattern section visually distinguishes the two types — separate groupings or a type badge per row; (2) counts, cost, and availability (active/partial/roadmap) tracked and displayed per type group; (3) AiBadge labels and tooltips app-wide identify pattern type so users can see whether an element is using structural or reasoning architecture; (4) Platform Roadmap section groups roadmap patterns by type. Registry field: `patternType: 'structural' | 'reasoning'`. All 20 patterns in PATTERN_CATALOG must be classified before S-PAT-REGISTRY-01 coding begins. Depends on AI-35. Classification locked 2026-06-16: Structural (9) = RAG, Streaming, Structured Output, Embeddings, Browser Automation, Guardrails, Parallelization, HyDE, Adaptive RAG. Reasoning (11) = ReAct, Tool Use, Prompt Chaining, Reflection, HITL, Agent Orchestration, Few-Shot Prompting, LLM-as-Judge, Multi-Agent Debate, Chain-of-Verification, Episodic Memory. | ✅ Done | S-AI-PATTERN-TYPE-01 (22c9d2e) + patch (26ff072) |

**AI-22 Notes:** `ai_activity_log` currently has `ai_type`, `feature`, `model`, `agent_id`, `task_id` — a pre-Agent-Profile-Model categorization. The four new columns are additive and nullable — no existing data affected. Once present, every AI call has a full lineage chain. The platform's own internal capabilities (Task Planning, Title Generation, Agent Routing) are themselves Deliverables produced by agents — they must also carry these columns, making the platform self-describing.

**AI-23 Notes:** The existing "By Activity Type" 9 categories are a temporary categorization that predates the Agent Profile Model. Once the `competencies` and `capabilities` taxonomy tables exist (S-INFRA-01), the AI Audit views rebuild on top of them. Old activity type rows are remapped to `capability_slug` values via a one-time backfill. New views: By Competency (Identity/Skills/Knowledge/Deliverables spend), By Capability (which capabilities cost the most), By Level (what quality level is the platform operating at).

**AI-24 Notes:** The feedback loop requires DL-04 (`deliverables` table with `status: approved / change_requested`) to be live first. Score formula TBD in design session — likely: approval_rate × recency_weight × level_factor. Score stored per `(agent_id, capability_slug)` pair. Used as a tiebreaker when multiple agents have matching Capability + Level.

**AI-17 Notes:** `web-memory.js` POST currently hardcodes Brent's persona and "Portal Navigation" category. Extract into `/api/auto-train` accepting: `agent_id`, `source_type` (portal_run | document | conversation | test_result), and the raw artifact payload. `web-memory.js` POST becomes a thin caller. Enables any future capability to write training entries without duplicating the embed+write pattern. Design session required before coding — needs: input schema, per-agent persona selection, source_type → synthesis prompt mapping, category mapping.

**AI-10 Notes:** Accessible via "AI Audit" button in header. Primary view grouped by AI type (not chronological). Per type: total calls, estimated cost, avg latency, locations triggered (expandable). Session-scoped data in S16a; lifetime data wires in S16b.

**AI-11 Notes:** Logs per step: step_id, agent_id, model, tokens_in, tokens_out, latency_ms, rag_hits, confidence_score, timestamp. Data source for AI-10 and AI-12.

**AI-12 Notes:** Per-task, per-step breakdown: tokens in/out, model used, latency, RAG hits/misses, confidence, timestamp. Exportable report for IT/procurement governance. Distinct from AI-10 (Activity Panel = global view; AI-12 = deep dive per task). Builds with mock data in S-AI-01; live data after S11.

**AI-13 Notes (S16a spec — LOCKED):**
- Panel renamed: "AI Audit" (was "AI Activity Panel")
- Header button in AppShell: "AI Audit" (was "AI")
- Header strip: Total Calls · Total Cost · Active Types · Models in Use — Clear Log button removed
- Section 1 — By Activity Type: 9 Phase 1 types (adding Knowledge Reinforcement — Brent self-learning write-back to Supabase), 4 Future Tracking planned rows. Columns: Total, Est. Cost, Avg Latency. 30D column removed.
- Section 2 — By LLM: dynamic, grouped by model. Columns: Provider, Model, Total Calls, Est. Cost, Avg Latency
- Section 3 — Future Tracking (planned, grayed): Agent Performance Score · Prompt Version Tracking · Cost Anomaly Detection · Human Review Rate
- Section 4 — By Agent: dynamic, any agentId in log gets a row. Columns: Agent Name, Code, Total Calls, Est. Cost, Avg Latency. Unknown agentIds fall back to raw ID.
- Architect Checklist tab: NO CHANGES — already complete (AI-15 ✅ Done)
- Data: session-scoped in S16a. Lifetime persistence added in S16b.

**AI-16 Notes (S16b spec — LOCKED):**
- Table already exists in Supabase: `ai_activity_log` (NOT `ai_call_log` — spec corrected 2026-06-07 via MCP)
- Actual columns: id, tenant_id, ai_type, feature, model, agent_id, task_id, input_tokens, output_tokens, latency_ms, knowledge_tier, cost_usd, created_at
- No migration needed — table created prior to S16b
- No separate backend endpoint — `logAICall()` writes directly to Supabase client (fire-and-forget)
- `logAICall()` extended with optional `taskId` param; non-blocking insert to `ai_activity_log`
- New `hydrateFromSupabase()` function seeds in-memory store on panel mount
- On panel mount: reads `ai_activity_log` from Supabase (limit 500, desc) and seeds the in-memory store
- Result: metrics accumulate from S16b commit day, never reset
- Kickoff doc: `docs/kickoffs/v5.1.19-AI16-ai-audit-persistence.md`

## DELIVERABLES — DL

> **Q5 RESOLVED 2026-06-13:** Step outputs and task deliverables are two tiers of the same first-class object. Step deliverables (`step_id` set) are intermediate; task deliverables (`is_final: true`, no `step_id`) are the assembled final output. Both live in the `deliverables` table. User can inspect any step deliverable and approve or request a change. Change requests go back to the assigned agent and update the final task deliverable when resolved. Every deliverable links to `agent_id` → surfaces on the agent's Projects tab (PE-06) and feeds the adaptive learning loop (change requests = training signal).

| ID | Feature | Status | Session |
|----|---------|--------|---------|
| DL-01 | Step output type label (Michelle assigns at plan time — Research / Analysis / Report / Review / etc.) | ❌ Missing | S-DELIVER-01 |
| DL-02 | Deliverables Card — right panel on task view; shows final task deliverable + link to each step's output | ❌ Missing | S-DELIVER-02 |
| DL-03 | Per-step deliverable access inline — click step → open its deliverable; approve or request change | ❌ Missing | S-DELIVER-03 |
| DL-04 | `deliverables` table — two-tier model: step deliverables (step_id set) + task final (is_final: true); columns: id, tenant_id, task_id, step_id, agent_id, type, title, content jsonb, format, status (draft/approved/change_requested), is_final, is_shared, share_token, price_usd, created_at | ❌ Missing | S-DELIVER-04 |
| DL-05 | Change request flow — user requests revision on a step deliverable; status → change_requested; agent is notified; resolution updates final task deliverable; change request is a training signal fed to adaptive learning | ❌ Missing | S-DELIVER-04 |
| DL-06 | Supervised training feedback loop — approved deliverables can be flagged for ingestion; change request resolutions auto-flagged; user confirms before vectorization | ❌ Missing | S-DELIVER-05 |
| DL-07 | Agent work history on Projects tab (PE-06) — wired to `deliverables` table; shows deliverable count, types, task names, dates per agent; categorizes what kind of work each agent is capable of | ❌ Missing | S-DELIVER-04 |
| DL-08 | Deliverable sharing — signed URL, public preview (partial) vs. paid full access tiers | ❌ Missing | S-DELIVER-06 |
| DL-09 | Deliverable marketplace — publish, price, sell; 30/60/10 split (platform/IP owner/infrastructure) | ❌ Missing | S-future (Phase 4) |
| DL-10 | Web Research Report + Data Fetch as `deliverables` table entries — on ReAct run completion (DONE or DOWNLOAD terminal state), write deliverable record to `deliverables` table. Covers Web Research Report (synthesis content) and Data Fetch/Dataset (file reference + metadata). Enables DL-02, DL-05, DL-07 for Brent and Pat runs. | ❌ Missing | S-DELIVER-04 |
| DL-11 | Task / Step Plan as `deliverables` table entry — on "Approve Steps & Launch", write approved plan as type: "plan", is_final: false; becomes parent record of all step-level deliverables produced during execution; enables plan history, plan-level change requests, Michelle attribution on Projects tab | ❌ Missing | S-DELIVER-04 |
| DL-12 | Flags Report + Data Analysis Report as `deliverables` table entries — when user views Flags Report or exports analysis from Analyzer, write deliverable record; type: "flags_report" and "analysis_report" respectively; no ✦ AI badge on Flags Report (deterministic); enables DL-02 and DL-07 for Analyzer outputs | ❌ Missing | S-DELIVER-04 |

**DL-10 Notes (locked 2026-06-15, S-DELIVER-DESIGN Part 2):**
- Same `deliverables` table as all other deliverable types — no new table
- Web Research Report: `type: "web_research_report"`, `agent_id: "brent"` (or "pat"), `content: jsonb` with synthesis text + run metadata
- Data Fetch/Dataset: `type: "dataset"`, `agent_id: "brent"` (or "pat"), `content: jsonb` with file reference + row count + column summary
- Both written on terminal state (DONE or DOWNLOAD) in the Railway ReAct loop → Vercel write via Supabase client
- Both go through approve/change-request flow (DL-05) when surfaced in Deliverables Card (DL-02)
- Self-Learning Write-back (M-04 in CAPABILITIES.md) continues to write to `knowledge_entries` independently — two separate write targets from one run
- Depends on: DL-04 (`deliverables` table), M-03 ReAct Loop terminal state detection

**DL-11 Notes (locked 2026-06-15, S-DELIVER-DESIGN Part 2):**
- Written at "Approve Steps & Launch" — same moment `task.status` moves to "active"
- `type: "plan"`, `is_final: false` — not the terminal deliverable, but the parent record
- `content: jsonb` — stores the full approved step array (same structure as `task.steps` JSONB)
- `step_id: null`, `agent_id: "michelle"` (PP-01)
- Step deliverables produced during execution reference this record as their parent via `task_id`
- Enables Michelle's work to appear on her Projects tab (PE-06 / DL-07) — she is the planner of record
- Depends on: DL-04 (`deliverables` table), AW-11 (Approve Steps & Launch)

**DL-12 Notes (locked 2026-06-15, S-DELIVER-DESIGN Part 2):**
- Flags Report: `type: "flags_report"`, no `agent_id` (deterministic, no agent authorization), `content: jsonb` with flag array + dollar amounts
- Data Analysis Report: `type: "analysis_report"`, no `agent_id`, `content: jsonb` with summary stats + tab-level outputs
- Written when user views or exports — not on CSV upload (analysis runs client-side; write triggered by user action)
- No ✦ AI badge on Flags Report — deterministic capability per ARCHITECTURE.md badge rule
- Data Analysis Report carries Mixed type — Concerns tab (deterministic) + AI Review tab (AI) — badge applies to AI Review tab only
- Depends on: DL-04 (`deliverables` table), AZ-01 (CSV upload), M-06 Flag Computation

## AGENT ARCHITECTURE — AA
> Full spec: docs/AGENT-ARCHITECTURE.md (created S-AGENT-ARCH-01)

### Phase 1 — Foundation

| ID | Feature | Status | Session |
|----|---------|--------|---------|
| AA-01 | `agent_character` table — character settings per agent (philosophy, skeptic_level, autonomy_level, temporal_stance, epistemology, confidence_calibration, peter_principle, collaboration_role, ethical_constraints, learning_stance, lock states per field) | ❌ Missing | S-INFRA-01 |
| AA-02 | `training_type` column on `knowledge_entries` — tags: knowledge / behavioral / reasoning / character | ❌ Missing | S-INFRA-01 |
| AA-03 | DB Assembly (`api/prompt/db-assembly.js`) — reads capability_slug + agent_id, queries Supabase (agent_configs / capabilities / skill_profiles), returns Prompt Request organized by source. Required: tenant_id + task_context. Optional: agent_id, capability_slug. No AI calls, no writes. Degrades gracefully on missing data. | ✅ Done | S-PM-02 |
| AA-43 | AI Enrichment (`api/prompt/ai-enrichment.js`) — takes Prompt Request, executes platform patterns: RAG (agent/capability/platform-wide scope), REFLECT, intelligent synthesis. Resolves conflicts and duplication from multiple sources. Returns assembled system prompt + debug object. All patterns always run regardless of DB content availability. | ✅ Done | S-PM-03a |
| AA-53 | Seed knowledge entries for Michelle (pp-01) — capability-registry-knowledge skill profile has no knowledge_entries rows scoped to pp-01. RAG section is always omitted for Michelle until seeded. Seed with: capability registry docs, DeepBench agent roster, skill type definitions. | ✅ Done | S-PM-03b |
| AA-44 | Request & Receivable (`api/prompt/request-receivable.js`) — Send + Parse + Guardrails (PAT-13) + Deliver via handler registry. Direct Anthropic fetch (no adapter). Guardrails post-generation Haiku check. Handler registry delegates to `api/lib/handlers/store.js` (content) or future dispatch/mcp/package handlers (action). Server-side ai_activity_log write with `patterns_used`. Full deliverables table write including LLM-generated `title`. | ❌ Missing | S-PM-04b |
| AA-54 | Handler registry expansion — `api/lib/handlers/dispatch.js` (route to agent/capability-route), `api/lib/handlers/package.js` (prose → docx/pdf), `api/lib/handlers/mcp.js` (call MCP server with result). Action deliverable category: `format: "action"`, `handler: "dispatch"` or `"mcp"`. Hybrid deliverable: runs both store + action handlers. `format_contract.handler` slug on Format Skill Profile routes to correct module. Design session required. | ❌ Missing | S-future (design required) |
| AA-55 | Server-side `ai_activity_log` write pattern for all Prompt Service routes — currently only `request-receivable.js` logs server-side. When MCP callers or non-frontend callers are introduced for DB Assembly or AI Enrichment, those routes need server-side logging too. Extend pattern to `db-assembly.js` and `ai-enrichment.js`. | ❌ Missing | S-future (MCP era) |
| AA-45 | Multi-LLM conflict resolution — when multiple Skill Profiles in a Capability declare different LLM configs, resolve by Format Skill priority. Platform defaults handle for now. | ❌ Missing | S-future (design required) |
| AA-46 | User-declared priority in task_context — formal parsing of priority signals embedded in the task string (e.g. "urgent", section weighting). AI Enrichment surfaces naturally for now. | ❌ Missing | S-future |
| AA-47 | DB Assembly relevance flagging — lightweight AI annotation on Prompt Request sections to guide AI Enrichment prioritization. Deferred until pipeline is proven. | ❌ Missing | S-future (design required) |
| AA-48 | RAG query expansion — use AI to expand task_context into richer search queries before RAG retrieval. Belongs to AI Enrichment layer. | ❌ Missing | S-future (design required) |
| AA-49 | Contextual Compression — before injecting RAG chunks into the prompt, run a compression pass that strips irrelevant sentences from each chunk, keeping only the portion directly relevant to the query. Reduces token usage without losing coverage. Belongs in AI Enrichment Fetch step, runs after RAG retrieval and before Render. Design session required. | ❌ Missing | S-future (design required) |
| AA-50 | Semantic Caching — cache assembled prompts (AI Enrichment output) by capability + agent + query similarity. Near-identical queries return cached prompt without re-running RAG + REFLECT + synthesis. Directly addresses the open DB Assembly caching decision in PROMPT-SERVICE-MODEL.md. Design session required before coding. | ❌ Missing | S-future (design required) |
| AA-51 | format_contract validation skill — pre-flight Capability check before DB Assembly runs; detects missing Format Skill Profiles and surfaces a structured gap signal to the caller rather than silently defaulting to html. Future direction: validation skill asks capability-level clarifying questions to close the gap before execution. Design session required. | ❌ Missing | S-future (design required) |
| AA-52 | Synthesis quality gate — after Intelligent Synthesis rewrites the assembled prompt, run a LLM-as-Judge (PAT-15) verification pass to confirm all guardrails, format instructions, and factual constraints survived the rewrite. If any are missing, restore from pre-synthesis version. Belongs in AI Enrichment Step 4. Design session required. | ❌ Missing | S-future (design required) |
| AA-04 | Two-speed routing — fast path (chat, DB only, Haiku, top 3 RAG) vs. deep path (tasks, full assembly, Sonnet, top 10+ RAG); agent depth level sets default, task complexity can override upward | ❌ Missing | S-INFRA-01 |

### Phase 2 — Intelligence Visibility

| AA-07 | Capability Score (CS) — separate 0–100: breadth (capabilities assigned / available) × depth (avg depth level). Displayed alongside AIS | ❌ Missing | S-AIS-01 |
| AA-08 | Knowledge hunger mechanic — freshness decay curve (100% day 0–30, 85% day 31–60, 70% day 61–90, 50% day 91–180, 30% day 181+, stale flag); hunger states: Fed / Peckish / Hungry / Starving | ❌ Missing | S-HUNGER-01 |
| AA-09 | Domain coverage map — visual grid of topic areas, named gaps, specific upgrade prompts per gap | ❌ Missing | S-HUNGER-01 |
| AA-10 | Training streak — weekly cadence, bonus AIS points (4wk +2, 12wk +5, 52wk +10 + badge) | ❌ Missing | S-HUNGER-01 |
| AA-11 | Character Layer L2–L4 training — behavioral-tagged, character-tagged RAG retrieval; character deepens through training material uploads | ❌ Missing | S-CHAR-02 |

| AA-20 | BYOK economics — 40% markup when platform provides keys; BYOK pays subscription only | ❌ Missing | S-REV-01 |

### Phase 5 — Scale and Enterprise

| ID | Feature | Status | Session |
|----|---------|--------|---------|
| AA-21 | John Leonard agent (JL-01) — persona replication reference implementation; Philosophy + Ethical Constraints locked; all other character settings supervised adaptive; training priority: annotated session transcripts → ARCHITECTURE.md → behavioral docs → domain docs | ❌ Missing | S-JL-01 (design session required) |
| AA-22 | Test Agent console — full dimension testing (extends PE-12); one scenario per dimension; Test Scorecard per run (Output Quality, Character Alignment, Confidence Calibration, RAG chunks, Reasoning depth, Depth delta, Verdict + suggested training) | ❌ Missing | S-MIGRATE-06 (spec updated) |
| AA-23 | Test Team cross-agent depth comparison (extends existing Test Team screen — NIGP "Bee" pattern); same task run at L1/L2/L3, scorecard per depth | ❌ Missing | S-TEST-01 |

### Future Backlog (design session required before scheduling)

| ID | Feature | Status | Session |
|----|---------|--------|---------|
| AA-24 | Multi-agent workflow handoff design — collaboration roles (Lead/Execute/Challenge/Synthesize) and how agents pass work in a task workflow | ❌ Missing | S-future |
| AA-25 | Deliverables marketplace UI — discovery, preview, purchase flow for other tenants' published capabilities and deliverables | ❌ Missing | S-future |
